You step into the elevator and when the doors are closing Michael (your boss) rushes inside.

Michael: Hi, you must be our new intern, welcome to Dunder Mifflin!
(HINT: type 'hi' to say hi)

> hi

Michael: During your internship you should obtain 3 (hopefully positive) reviews from other employees. Look around the office and see what you can do. When you are ready come to my room and I will take a look. Good luck!
(HINT: type 'enter' to enter the office)

> enter

As you step out of the elevator you enter the office openspace...
You see Jim approaching you with a big smile...

Jim: Hi, I'm Jim! I'm glad to have the opportunity to assign to you something useful that will prove your competence. Dwight is working in our office, he's my best friend who LOVES jelly and staplers. Play him a funny prank, and I'll sign off on your task completion. It's worth checking out his desk in the openspace. Good luck!

You stop in front of the bathroom door. You place your hand on the door handle...
...and suddenly you hear furious German swearing words coming from the inside.
HINT: knock or go kitchen

> knock

Dwight (from the inside): Hey, wait! Temp, is that you? You have to help me. I've been locked inside.
Dwight: If you help me and tell nothing to Jim I will give you my recommendation.
You: How on Earth are you locked inside?
Dwight: I have forgotten that I had recently changed code to my padlock...
You: Do you always lock yourself in a bathroom with a padlock?
Dwight: Of course, Temp. I value my privacy, I always have my military padlock with digit code.
Dwight: For security reasons I change the code every month... Temp, you have to help me!

Enter the number of dialogue option:

You: Do you have your new code saved somewhere?
Dwight: No, are you stupid, Temp? I never write down any code. I have e n c r y p t e d it.
You: So why don't you d e c r y p t it?
Dwight: Because I have forgotten how I encrypted it... I have my notes here, though.
Dwight: I will tell you first numbers of a sequence, and you have to find the next element. This is going to be a part of the code.

Find the next element: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

You hear some clicking and cracking and, to your surprise, the bathroom door opens and you see Dwight coming out from the bathroom
Dwight: Did I forget the code for real? FALSE. I was just checking whether you have basic math skills, Temp.
Dwight: Here you have my reference, but don't imagine that you have proved yourself useful.
Dwight gives you a sheet of paper with his signature and then moves to his desk in openspace. The bathroom is open now.


Some toilets, sinks, and rather unhealthy smell. The toilet paper seems to be missing as usual. Nothing too interesting here.
